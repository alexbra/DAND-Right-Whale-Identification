It will place those images in a folder (`files_for_annotation`) two levels up (alongside the `imgs` folder). After you have run this script, annotate the images using the sloth program. When you are done, use the `check_annotations` folder below to make sure that your annotations are correct. When you are happy with the json file that you created, give it a name (like `annotations_kevin_1.json`) and submit a pull request to have it included with the others."
