Here is a brief todo list for developing the whale classifier:

 - annotate images (see [here](https://github.com/kburnham/DAND-Right-Whale-Identification/blob/master/ImageAnnotation/AnnotateImages.md))

 - train a good HAAR classifier and a good LBP classifier (see [here](https://github.com/kburnham/DAND-Right-Whale-Identification/blob/master/Using%20AWS%20to%20Train%20a%20Cascade%20Classifier.md))

 - train a whale classifier using `dlib` - (see [here](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/02/dlib-186-released-make-your-own-object.html))

 - train a whale classifier with a convnet? (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition/forums/t/16684/alternative-approaches-to-whale-localization/93546))

 - write code that generates a heat map on an image based on the combined results of multiple classifiers

 - coordinate with identifier team and make sure that our outputs and their inputs match up.
